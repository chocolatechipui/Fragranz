A reference app for ChocolateChip-UI using Soma-template to create a prototype perfumes app.


To see this running, you'll need to first run a server instance in this directory. If you've got Python, you can just run this in your terminal/command prompt:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

This is just a prototype. It's purpose is to show how to take the different pieces of ChocolateChip-UI and put together a working app. It's not meant to be complete. The code contains no models or controllers. The shopping cart is not complete. There is no backend database. All those decisions are ones the developer will need to make based on coding styles and development preferences. 

We've used Soma-template to put this together, particular because of several features similar to Angularjs, such as repeaters, template scopes, template helpers, etc. It allowed us to pull this off with much less JavaScript than if it were all plain JavaScript.
